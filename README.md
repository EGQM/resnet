# resnet
Example code for [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)

I have only tested this code on [timyimagenet data](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip)

This code is outdated and the example have moved to https://github.com/shuokay/mxnet/blob/master/example/image-classification/symbol_resnet-small.py.
